vocker - Create VMs not containers
==================================

vocker can read Dockerfiles (currently just a subset), and does
build VM images from them.

Instead of using the docker registry for base images, `virt-builder`
images can be used as `FROM` sources.

vocker is building the images incerementally, for each command.
It caches the images, which makes it fast.

> Note: This is WIP. Not all features are supported (yet).

A quick demo:

Installation
------------

```bash
$ pip install -rrequirements.txt
$ python setup.py install
```

Usage
-----

The usage should look familiar:

```bash
$ vocker build --tag simple -f examples/Dockerfile.simple
$ vocker run simple
fast_fedora
$ vocker attach fast_fedora

# Export an image
$ vocker export simple -f simple.raw
```

Kubernetes Vocker Builder Usage
-------------------------------

In addition to the stock vocker tool, there is also a container and manifest
to run vocker as a builder inside a Kubernetes cluster.

The use-case is to use vocker, to build an VM image "onto" a block PV.
The job definition is kept in the `manifests/` directory.

In order to build a specific image, a vockerfile was to be written into the
`vocker-job-source` ConfigMap.
The ConfigMap is mapping a key to a vockerfile. The key will be used as the
resulting image filename, which will be written on to the target PV, which is
also defined in the Job definition.

In order to build you custom images, you need to complete the following steps:

1. Add entry to ConfigMap
2. Adjust Job to point to the PV to be populated
3. Run job to generate images


An example ConfigMap (the name is relevant):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: vocker-job-source
data:
  Fedora: |
    FROM fedora:26
    
    MAINTAINER "Fabian Deutsch" <fabiand@redhat.com>
    ENV container docker
    
    RUN echo Hello > /marker
    
    EXPOSE 1234
    
    CMD echo World >> /marker

  Ubuntu: |
    FROM ubuntu-16.04
```

This ConfigMap would build two images `Fedora` and `Ubuntu`.

The usage then looks like:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f manifests/vocker-builder-wo-presets.yaml
$ kubectl describe job vocker-builder
Name:           vocker-builder
Namespace:      default

  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  40m   job-controller  Created pod: vocker-builder-xkckj

```

Once the pod has completed it's work, the image is ready on the PV.

Hacking
-------

When in the source folder:

```bash
$ pip install -rrequirements-dev.txt
```

to install the dependencies.

```bash
$ python setup.py test
```

to run the tests.


```bash
$ python vocker.py --help
```

to run your local developer version.

Why?
----

I think it's a nice approach to have a declarative approach
for creating VMs.

Tips
----

### Setting the root password

By default a random root password is chosen. If you have to set the password
during build time you can add the build instruction

```
RUN echo "mypass" | passwd --stdin
```
